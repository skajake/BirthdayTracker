# BirthdayTracker

Contributors to this project may earn merit tokens called BTT as a token of my gratitude.  
I might choose to solicit token holders for input on decision making in this project.
I might chose to reward token holders in the future as a token of my gratitude.
BTT tokens have no monetary value.

This project will be run with a degree of transparency that I feel is appropriate.

You may view structural details around this app and the merit tokens on Aragon:

Please include your ethereum address in pull requests if you wish to be rewarded with merit tokens.

From time to time I may suggest the number of merit tokens to be awarded to those that succesfully merge a PR for specific issues.
